# Customer-Churn-Analysis-using-ANN
<p>Customer churn analysis is a process of using a churn data to understand about the customers who are leaving a platfrom and to discover the reason behind it.</p>
<p>I utilized a dataset from Kaggle to develop a customer churn prediction model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The model architecture includes two hidden layers and one output layer. I used a sequential model with the loss function 'binary_crossentropy' and the optimizer 'Adam.' After running the model for 200 epochs, it achieved an accuracy of 86%.</p>
